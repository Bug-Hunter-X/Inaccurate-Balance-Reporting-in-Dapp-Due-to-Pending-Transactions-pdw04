This repository demonstrates a common bug in Dapps: inaccurate balance reporting due to the neglect of pending transactions. The `balanceOf` function in the `bug.sol` file directly returns the balance from the `balances` mapping, without considering pending transactions that might increase or decrease an account's balance.  The `bugSolution.sol` file provides a corrected implementation.
